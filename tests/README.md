# tests

Owned by the **Validation/Test Agent** (GDD §5.2, agent 3).

Automated tests proving the Simulation Core Agent's output matches the
GDD's tables and formulas exactly — not just "it runs," but "it runs
correctly" (e.g. a gold-tier refiner narrows variance to -0.5%/+15% exactly,
not approximately). Must cover: quality roll distribution and clamping
(1–100), null/NA exclusion, refining formula at each refiner tier, refund
chance behavior, crafting formula at each crafter/schematic tier
combination, the threshold penalty curve including the hard floor at 41+
points below threshold, and the +18% combined ceiling cap.

This agent tests and reports only — it must never modify Simulation Core
logic to make a failing test pass.

**Running tests:** `npm test` runs `node --test`, which recursively
discovers `*.test.ts` files (Node's built-in type-stripping runs them
directly, no build step or transpiler needed — confirmed working on the
Node version this project targets). Mirror `src/`'s folder layout here
(e.g. `tests/simulation/refine.test.ts`) so each test file's home maps
obviously to the module it covers.

Nothing has been written here yet.
